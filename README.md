Sure! Here's a clean and clear `README.md` file for your **Parking Management System** project:

```markdown
# 🚗 Parking Management System

This is a simple terminal-based Java program for managing a motorbike parking system. The system allows users to register, check in, and check out using a unique ID and plate number. All data is stored in text files.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The project includes the following Java files:

- `Main.java` — Runs the menu system for Check-In, Check-Out, or Exit.
- `Register.java` — Allows users to register with their name, ID, and plate number.
- `Checkin.java` — Checks in registered users by matching their ID with stored records.
- `Checkout.java` — (Assumed to exist; used for checking out, although not shown here.)

---

## 📝 How to Run the Program

### ✅ Requirements

- Java JDK installed (version 8 or higher).
- A terminal or IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

---

### 📦 Steps to Compile and Run

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt** in your project folder.

2. **Compile all Java files**:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java Register.java Checkin.java Checkout.java
   ```

3. **Run the main program**:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

4. To run registration separately:
   ```bash
   java Register
   ```

## 🗃️ Data Storage Files

The system uses the following `.txt` files:

- `register.txt` — Stores registered users: `name, id, platenumber`
- `check_in.txt` — Stores check-in logs: `name, id, platenumber, date/time`
- `check_out.txt` — (Assumed file for check-out logs)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Plate numbers must match the format `2XX-1234` (e.g., `2AB-1234`).
- User ID must be a positive number.
- Each ID must be unique in the `register.txt` file.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Tips

- If `register.txt` doesn't exist, the system will create it automatically.
- Use `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` carefully to avoid file access errors.
- Customize the UI or expand functionality using a GUI (like Java Swing) in the future or web-based GUI (HTML, CSS, Javascript or other framework)
